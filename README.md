>(Java+LibGDX) Physical puzzel sketchout, similar to 'Cut the Rope'

This project is based on LibGDX an physical collisions areas were edited in Overlap2D.

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some design patterns (Abstract Factory, Strategy, Visitor)</li>
  <li>LibGDX library usage</li>
  <li>I could experiment classes management and patterns, the referencing of objects and passing them as parameters in constructors or methods, versus the <i>static</i> property usage.</li>
</ul>
