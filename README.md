# physical-puzzle
>(Java+LibGDX) Physical puzzel sketchout, similar to 'Cut the Rope'

Project based on LibGDX, physical collisions areas edited in Overlap2D.
The project was abandoned when Overlap2D support winded up and given small defects in the library and the rise of Unity3D. Nevertheless, it was an interesting showdown with the library.

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some design patterns (Abstract Factory, Strategy, Visitor)</li>
  <li>I could experiment classes management and patterns, the referencing of objects and passing them as parameters in constructors or methods, versus the usage of the <i>static</i> property.</li>
  <li>LibGDX library usage</li>
</ul>
